I am a Machine Learning Researcher coming from mathematics (Probability Theory/ Statistical Mechanics). I work as a postdoctoral researcher at [Orange Labs](https://lelab.orange.fr/) on Computational Trust Modeling through Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Before that, I have worked as a consultant data scientist at [Aristas](https://www.aristas.com.ar/).
I am Adjunct Professor (on leave) at the Mathematics Department of the [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.fi.uba.ar/institucional/departamentos/matematica) at Universidad de Buenos Aires and Assistant Researcher (on leave) at [Instituto de Cálculo](https://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/). 

I have done a Phd. in Mathematics at [Leiden University](https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/probability/index.php) under the supervision of [Frank den Hollander](https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~denholla/) and [Roberto Fernández](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/roberto-fernandez). Afterwards I returned to Argentina where I continued with a postdoc at [Universidad de Buenos Aires](http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~probab/). There, I collaborated with [Pablo Groisman](http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~pgroisma/) and [Matthieu Jonckhee](http://matthieujonckheere.blogspot.com/).
